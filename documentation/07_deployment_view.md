7 Deployment View 
===============

**Content.**

The deployment view describes:

1.  the technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with
    infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments,
    computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other
    infrastructure elements and

2.  the mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure
    elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development
environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you
should document all relevant environments.

Especially document the deployment view when your software is executed
as distributed system with more then one computer, processor, server or
container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors
and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture those elements
of the infrastructure that are needed to show the deployment of your
building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe the
infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

**Motivation.**

Software does not run without hardware. This underlying infrastructure
can and will influence your system and/or some cross-cutting concepts.
Therefore, you need to know the infrastructure.

Maybe the highest level deployment diagram is already contained in
section 3.2. as technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE
black box. In this section you will zoom into this black box using
additional deployment diagrams:

-   UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it,
    probably with nested diagrams, when your infrastructure is more
    complex.

-   When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams
    rather than the deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is
    able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.
